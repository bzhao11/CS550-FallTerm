# CS550-FallTerm

PrimFinal

I've used Prim's Algorithm to generate a maze via the extended Ascii Code. The first few lines are error checking for negative and small numbers, Also, 
the first few lines are error checking strings. Then, the code uses the concept of frontier cells to clear up passage ways for the maze, since the 
code in the first few lines already create a 2d arraw of walls. 
Since same numbers for width and height of the maze will produce different mazes, please try the same number multiple times if it initally doesn't work. 
Thanks!

Mandelbrot
For this project, I really wanted to have at least two fractal images that would contrast but complement each other. As a result, my first and third 
image does just that. Since they have the same calculations for the color portion of the code, I specifically spent quite a bit of time finding a balanced
but contrasting fractal in the mandelbrot set. As a result, I incorporate a spiral for my first image and a vein type picture in my third image. 

The Julia set I incorporated into my second image was just a really cool extension of the red/purple color I was going for. I did some extra research and 
thought the fractal that was printed was really cool so I decided to add that in. The Julia set also connects to the other two as it brings a mistique to the 
red/green + blue theme I have going. 

Etoa

Etoa is a world where you can hunt dragons, play blackjack, or even go fishing. It gives the user flexibility with the games that the user wants to play. I hope you enjoy!
